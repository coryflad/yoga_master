            <p>
                Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your youga mat with your arms at your side with
                palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries 
                slip away. When you rae ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting 
                position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer postion. Be grateful for all that your 
                have in life. Namaste.
